When creating a patch of the last commit, use

    git format-patch -s --subject-prefix='meta-solidrun-arm-imx6][PATCH' -1

Patches are normally intended for the master branch.

Patches for other branches should be sent separately so they can be tracked
individually in Patchwork and should have the branch name in brackets.

For example, use this to generate a patch for branch 'fido':

    git format-patch -s \
	--subject-prefix='meta-freescale][meta-solidrun-arm-imx6][fido][PATCH' -1
